# Seysen Reduction (CUDA/C++) — Work in Progress

**Work in Progress — Not Production Ready**

This repository contains an early-stage CUDA/C++ implementation of the Seysen reduction algorithm.  
**Warning:** This codebase is experimental, not optimized, and should not be used in production or integrated into any final project.

## Prefer the CuPy/Python Version

At this stage, the CuPy/Python implementation (see `seysen_reduce_cupy.py`) is significantly more efficient and stable. strongly recommend using the Python/CuPy version for all benchmarking, research, and production work.

## Status

- The current CUDA/C++ implementation is incomplete and not optimized.
- Performance is far below the Python/CuPy alternative.
- Major refactoring and optimization are needed.
- Bugs, inefficiencies, and unexpected behaviors are expected.

## Roadmap

- Optimize CUDA kernels and memory management
